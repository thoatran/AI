# Explanation of modified points (required)
The TODO list has 3 parts to be completed. Thanks to that, function find_student() can do its own task (finding student by the name).
+ TODO 1: Because s_frame is the pointer to the given student information frame, so to iterate each student, we have run from i = 0 to i = s_frame->student_num.
+ TODO 2: Compare target student name (name) with name of each student (using function getname(s))
+ TODO 3: Write variable which satisfies condition.
I have already finished the task, then compile and run the program, by the following command lines:
       make test
       gcc -Wall -std=c99 -O2 -o ./a.out prog_06.c student.c human.c object.c score_board.c func.c
       diff -y --suppress-common-lines answer_06.txt result_06.txt
The result in file result_06.txt is the same with one in the file answer_06.txt
