# Explanation of modified points (required)
The TO-DO list has 3 parts to be completed in total.
+ TO-DO 1: Fill in the bank parts for defuzzy using centroid by establishing the defuzzification formular.
+ TO-DO 2: Build the member ships function based on Mamdani's fuzzy inference method.
+ TO-DO 3: Apply Mamdani's fuzzy inference method to compute membership values.
I have already completed all, then compile and run the program by the following command line:
           make test
           gcc -Wall -std=c99 -O2 -o ./a.out prog_09.c func.c 
           diff -y --suppress-common-lines answer_09.txt result_09.txt
The result in the output file(result_07.txt) is the same with in the file answer_07.txt.
