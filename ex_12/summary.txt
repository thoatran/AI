# Explanation of modified points (required)
The TO-DO list has 3 tasks to be completed in total.
+ TO-DO 1:  Write unipolar sigmoid function (lambda = 1).
                 sigmoid(x) = 1/(1 + exp(-x))
+ TO-DO 2: create a function to calculate the inner product 
+ TO-DO 3: calculate the error of the output layer for backpropagation with the activation function in this program is `the unipolar sigmoid function`.
+ TO-DO 4: Update weight based on backpropagation.

I have already finished the tasks , then compile and run the program by following command lines:
        Make test
        gcc -Wall -std=c99 -O2 -o ./a.out prog.c func.c
        diff -y --suppress-common-lines answer.txt result.txt
The result in file result.txt is the same with the one in file answer.txt
