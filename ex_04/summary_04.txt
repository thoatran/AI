# Explanation of modified points (required)
The TODO-list has 5 parts have to complete, which set the arguments, states, the conditions following the process of 4 types of searching algorithms including BFS, uniform cost, best first search and A star algorithm. The explanation of the implementation is easy to understand and follow so I have already finished the assignment, then compile and run the program by the below command lines:
     make test
     gcc -Wall -std=c99 -O2 -o ./a.out prog_04.c func.c s_queue.c
     diff -y --suppress-common-lines answer_04.txt result_04.txt
The result in the file result_03.txt is the same with one in the file answer_04.txt.


# Discussion (if needed)
 The exercise is very helpful for me to revise BFS algorithm and also learn how to implement new algorithm, which are uniform cost search, best first search and A* algorithm.

# Comments (if needed)
README.md file should have English version, especially for the international students like us to understand the program more clearly.
