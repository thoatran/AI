# Explanation of modified points (required)
I finished 3 tasks in the TO-DO list
+ TO-DO 1: Generate the weights (of the prototypes)randomly using frand_xorshift() function.
+ TO-DO 2: Find the Euclidean distance between a given pattern x and a prototype. and updated min_distance.
+ TO-DO 3: Update the weights of the winner neuron.

I have already finished all the tasks, then compile and run the program by the following command lines:
      make test
      make plot
      diff -y --suppress-common-lines answer.txt result.txt
The result in the file output result.txt is the same with the one in file answer.txt
