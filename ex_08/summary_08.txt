# Explanation of modified points (required)
+) For prog_08_01.pl
Because in Prolog, “⇒” is replaced by “:-”, and “∧” is replaced by “,” to make it easier to input the symbols using keyboard, I converted 
             p(X,Y) ∨ ¬q(X) ∨ ¬r(Y) into p(X, Y):- q(X), r(Y).
             q(X) ∨ ¬s(X)           into q(X):- s(X).
             r(Y) ∨ ¬t(Y)           into r(Y):- t(Y).
             s(a)                   into s(a).
             t(b)                   into t(b).
Then I run to test the program and the result was correct

+) For prog_08_02.pl: Try the program given in p. 29 by saving the program
The result was the same with one given in the slide.

# Discussion (if needed)
The exercise is useful for me to understand the simple program in Prolog
